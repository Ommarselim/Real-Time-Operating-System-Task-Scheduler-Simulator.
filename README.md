# Real-Time-Operating-System-Task-Scheduler-Simulator.

This project is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) Task Scheduler Simulator built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to simulate and visualize the scheduling of tasks in a real-time system using various scheduling algorithms. The project is designed to help users understand how different scheduling policies work in real-time systems and how tasks are prioritized and executed over time.

Project Overview
Project Name: Real-Time Operating System Task Scheduler Simulator
Purpose: A GUI-based application to simulate and visualize task scheduling in real-time operating systems using different scheduling algorithms.
Key Features:

Supports four scheduling algorithms:

Minimum Laxity First (MLF)

Earliest Deadline First (EDF)

Deadline Monotonic Assignment (DMA)

Rate Monotonic Assignment (RMA)

Allows users to input task parameters such as release time, execution time, period, and deadline.

Visualizes task execution timelines using matplotlib graphs.

Displays detailed results, including task priorities, broken deadlines, and execution timelines.

Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface using Tkinter.
